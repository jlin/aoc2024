- set up a dev environment
- use alire
- use vs code with the adacore plugin
- try to get hello world compiling and the debugger working

- these seemingly simple introductory steps, believe it or not, is one of the biggest roadblocks for me. If I can't get my code editor/IDE or a debugger working, I won't have a good time with this experience.
