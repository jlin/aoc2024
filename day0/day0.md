# day 0

## Tasks
[x] set up a dev environment

[x] use alire
        - `alr init --bin day0`

[x] use vs code with the adacore plugin

[x] get day0 compiling 

[ ] get the debugger working - this seems impossibly challenging to get gdb to work with vscode

## Notes
- These seemingly simple introductory steps took a whole day for me. The trick was **don't start with the demo hello world program, which has some dependencies**
- Instead, start with a blank "bin" project and build the program up from scratch.
- `--  ` for comments
- spacing is important for the linter
